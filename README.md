### **How to Run**

You will need Java 11 installed and maven (I used maven 3.8.1).

### **Assumptions**

* Assume all inputs are whole numbers

* Gross income is to always be rounded down

* Payment period is always one month

* All input data is valid

* Input super rate has % at end to remove

* Input csv always has a header row

* Assume csv input is delimited by a single "," with no spaces
